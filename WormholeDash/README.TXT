Wormhole Dash Rules:
- Merge of Irving Finkel vs Tom Scott and original Irving Finkel Rules, based on The Royal Game of Ur with modifications- 
- JFR Masters Route used-

1.	A player may choose any piece they wish to move if the result of that move lands the piece either on a vacant space, or within a battle engagement with an opposing player’s piece. (This also applies to starting a piece on the board)

2.	If a player rolls a number that lands their piece on a star, that player gets to roll again after moving their first piece and can choose to either move that same piece again or move a different piece.

3.	An exact dice throw is required to get a piece off the board or to start a battle engagement with another player. (i.e. If your piece is 3 spaces away from being off the board, you must roll a 3 to move that piece. Likewise, if a player piece you want to attack is 3 spaces away, you must roll a 3 to engage in battle with them.)

4.	Seven pieces will be used instead of 5, this a merger of the Tom Scott rules with the original rules.

5.	You win the game when all 7 of your pieces make it off the board. 

OR

6.	Modification 1: Each piece has an assigned tier level associated with them. These tiers range from 1-3, there are 3 tier I pieces, 3 tier II pieces, and 1 tier III piece for each player. Tier 1 is called a “Sputnik”, tier 2 is called a “Galileo”, and tier 3 is called an “Orbiter”.  If an “Orbiter” on either side is lost, that player that lost their “Orbiter” automatically loses the game.

7.	Modification 2: A player is said to be engaged in battle when a piece lands on a space that is occupied by an opposing player’s piece. However, that player does not automatically capture that piece. Instead, you “engage in a battle”, where the 2 pieces will have a chance to win the fight. This is done by using the previously mentioned tier system. To engage in battle, each piece takes turns rolling a die. The tier of the piece determines the number of dice rolls that the player gets to roll. The highest of all dice rolls is used for the outcome of the battle, favoring the defending player in the event of a tie (the player that occupied the space first.) Use the 6-sided die for engagements.

Detailed explanation on how to play:

When you load the game for the first time, the first thing you will need to do on either the web version of the game or the downloaded version is to locate the `run` button outside of the game scenario. 
Once you click the `run` button, the scenario should start. A good indicator that you have done this successfully is the music should start playing in the background. Next, located at the bottom right of the scenario screen there
is a red button next to a `Current Game Mode: ` line of text. Press this button until the game mode changes to the desired game mode. The options are "Human vs Human", "Human vs CPU", or "CPU vs CPU". Once the desired game mode has been
selected, you are ready to play the game! Player 1 will have to roll the die by clicking on the die icon. The die will give you a value that you are allowed to move any of the red spaceships that distance. Likewise, 
player 2 will follow the same steps of rolling the die and moving any of their blue spaceships (CPU will do this for you if the game has a CPU opponent). You continue this loop of gameplay until 1 of three things happen. One of those 
three things is one of your pieces may land on a lava looking star space. In the event your piece lands on one of these spaces, hooray! You get to roll again! The second of those three things is if you engage in a battle with another
player's pieces. What this means is that if a player already occupies a space, and you roll a number on the die that would have you move to that same space, a battle occurs! You do not need to do anything during this battle. Instead, 
the die will show you values that you and the other player are "rolling" (this speeds up the battle and streamlines it). Depending on the tier of ship that you have (tiers explained below this detailed explanation of play), will 
determine the amount of die rolls that your piece gets. At the end of the battle, the player that rolled the highest die roll value out of all of their rolls will win the battle (with a tie being a win for the defender to promote risk
of attacking another player). The winner of the battle gets to keep their piece on the space, and the loser's piece will be reset off the board and back into the starting zone. Lastly, when a piece makes it all the way through the
board to the end, it gets added to the `goal zone` opposite of your starting zone. Once all pieces for a given player have made it to the goal zone, the game is over and that player wins. Additionally, another way of winning the game
is to capture the opposing player's tier 3 piece in a battle. So think carefully and strategically about moving your tier 3 piece, as it must make it off the board as well to win that way but if you lose it in a battle YOU lose!

Explanation of piece tiers:

Each player has 3 tiers of pieces. The tiers of pieces are aligned with the lowest tier being the most left column of pieces in your cluster of pieces (3 total per player), 2nd tier being in the middle (3 total per player), 
and the 3rd tier as the sole large and detailed piece for each player. The tier level of the piece corresponds to how many rolls you get to roll in a battle. With a tier 1 piece rolling once, tier 2 rolling twice, 
and tier 3 rolling 3 times.
