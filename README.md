Final Project for B145: Object Oriented Programming 1 (Java)
 
   * This was a solo project where I was tasked with creating a game in a Java IDE called Greenfoot.
   
   * The game we needed to recreate in Java was "The Royal Game of Ur". After we created the original version
   * of the game, we were tasked with creating at least 1 major modification to the game along with polishing
   * the game. My major modification was a tier and battle system.
   
   * To run this code you will have to download the Greenfoot launcher from their website, or you can play the game directly from the website.
